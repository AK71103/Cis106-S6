Session 6 Assignment Problems – Loop Logic 1
Program Assignments – While Loops. Develop an IPO for each of the problems below. Place the IPO into
your repository. Then write code for each problem and place those files (py) into your repository. Paste
the link to your repository into the Assignment Completion Link on Blackboard.
1. Develop flowgorithm and code this this problem. Display the odd numbers starting at 1 and
ending with 25. Use a while loop structure for this problem.
2. Allow the user to enter a start value, stop value and increment value from the keyboard. Display
all the numbers from the start value to stop value using the increment value as you proceed.
Use a while loop structure for this problem.
3. Prompt the user on whether they want to do this program (just before the while loop). “Yes”
entry means they want to continue. Any other response indicates they will stop the program.
This response is the loop control variable. If the user answers “Yes “then go into the while loop.
Once in the while loop. You are to prompt the user for their last name and two exam scores.
Compute the average exam score. Display last name and average. After the loop, display a count
of the number of students who entered data.
Finally, the last statements within the while loop will ask the user if they want to do this loop
again. In other words the user needs to be prompted again. The reason is that the end of the
loop takes execution to the while condition to be evaluated again. It can not take us to the first
few lines of code that prompt the user for the first time. That code is out of the loop. Therefore,
we need a second prompt at the bottom, inside the loop.
4. Prompt the user on whether they want to do this program (just before the while loop). Yes
means they want to continue. Any other response indicates they will stop the program. This
response is the loop control variable. If the user answers Yes then go into the while loop.
Once in the while loop. You are to prompt the user for employee last name, hours worked and
rate of pay. Compute gross pay. Give the employee time and a half for hours worked over 40.
Sum the gross pay and count the number of employees.
For each employee display their last name and gross pay.
After the loop (all data entered) display the sum of all the gross pays, and count of the number
of employees. Compute and display the average pay.
Finally, the last statements within the while loop will ask the user if they want to do this loop
again. In other words the user needs to be prompted again. The reason is that the end of the
loop takes execution to the while condition to be evaluated again. It can not take us to the first
few lines of code that prompt the user for the first time. That code is out of the loop. Therefore,
we need a second prompt at the bottom, inside the loop.
5. Prompt the user on whether they want to do this program (just before the while loop). Yes
means they want to continue. Any other response indicates they will stop the program. This
response is the loop control variable. If the user answers Yes then go into the while loop.
Once in the while loop. You are to prompt the user for quantity and price of an item. Compute
extended price (quantity times price of an item. If the extended price is greater than 10000.00
compute a discount of 25%. All other orders get a 10% discount. For each order display
extended price, discount amount (extended price x discount percent), total (extended price –
discount amount).
For each order sum the discount amount.
After the loop (all data entered) display the sum of all the discounts.
Finally, the last statements within the while loop will ask the user if they want to do this loop
again. In other words the user needs to be prompted again. The reason is that the end of the
loop takes execution to the while condition to be evaluated again. It can not take us to the first
few lines of code that prompt the user for the first time. That code is out of the loop. Therefore,
we need a second prompt at the bottom, inside the loop.
